# SemEval-2024 Task 3: The Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations

# Abstract
We present a sub-task from Sem Eval-2023 Task 3, a shared task on extracting Textual emotion-cause pair extractions in conversations.This dataset consists of conversations involving multiple people. Each dialogue in the conversation is annotated with the corresponding emotion - neutral, joy, sadness, anger, surprise,
disgust, and fear. Every utterance with a nonneutral emotion has causal spans within the
conversation. The task of participating systems
was to predict the emotion of each utterance in a
set of conversations and also predict the causal
spans within the conversation. We are a group
of three who took part in this task. We present
our findings and results in this paper. In the end,
the best-performing model for emotion classification achieved a macro F1 score of 0.47 on
the validation set while the proportional span
match F1 score for the span detection model
was 0.6.
